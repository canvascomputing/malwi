# node-ipc "protestware" (Mar 2022)

## Carrier
peacenotwar, a dependency intentionally added by the node-ipc maintainer

## Technique
geolocates the running machine's IP address

## Payload/effect
wipes files if the IP geolocates to Russia or Belarus

## Detectable signal
an IP-geolocation call followed by a branch into destructive filesystem calls (unlink, rm,
overwrite) conditioned on the result
