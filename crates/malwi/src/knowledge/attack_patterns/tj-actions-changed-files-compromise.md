# tj-actions/changed-files Action compromise (CVE-2025-30066, Mar 2025)

## Carrier
an existing GitHub Action version tag (v35, v45, ...) retargeted to a new malicious commit
after a maintainer's access token was stolen

## Technique
injected code lives in the committed dist/index.js; most workflows pin a third-party Action
by mutable tag, not a commit hash

## Payload/effect
base64 Node.js snippet that runs a Python dumper reading /proc/[pid]/cmdline,
/proc/[pid]/maps, and /proc/[pid]/mem of the CI runner process; credentials printed,
lightly encoded, into the workflow's own public build logs

## Detectable signal
`.github/workflows/*.yml` pinning a third-party Action by tag or branch instead of a
commit hash; a dist/ bundle whose base64 blobs decode to /proc/ reads
