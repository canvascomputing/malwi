## Carrier
npm account takeover, malicious versions published under the real package name

## Technique
a preinstall script runs unconditionally on npm install

## Payload/effect
a platform-specific binary: cryptominer plus password stealer

## Detectable signal
package.json preinstall/postinstall that branches on process.platform then fetches and
executes a binary
